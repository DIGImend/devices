There are at least two versions of this model in the wild. They are represented by Genius G-Pen M609 (older version) and Genius G-Pen M609X (newer version).

Both versions have the usual pen with two barrel buttons and two identical wheels with center buttons in the top corners of the tablet base. They also have buttons on the top, between the wheels, for selecting the wheel functions and wide/standard mode. In the wide mode the whole working surface is sensed, in the standard mode a narrower area is sensed, but the logical report extents remain the same. These modes correspond roughly to 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios respectively.

The older version has three wheel function buttons ("scroll", "zoom" and "volume") and two separate buttons for wide and standard mode. The newer version has four wheel function buttons (plus "brush") and only one button is used for selecting wide/standard mode. So, the total number of buttons remains the same, but one of the mode buttons is repurposed as a wheel function button in the newer version.

The wheel functions are:

scroll  
the wheels act as scroll wheels, the center buttons switch between vertical and horizontal scrolling;

zoom  
the wheels zoom in/out, the buttons supposedly reset to 100%;

volume  
the wheels control the sound volume, the buttons mute;

brush  
the wheels are supposed to control brush width in a graphics editor, the buttons do nothing (supposed: right-click and double left-click).
