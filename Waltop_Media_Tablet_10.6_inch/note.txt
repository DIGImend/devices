No response to buttons.

The following information is based on the Silvercrest GTA2000 variant (aka Silvercrest SGT 10.6 A2), its manual and driver. (https://archive.org/details/silvercrest-driver)
The official Windows driver has a tool ("Macrokey Manager") to reconfigure tablet K1-K26 buttons, wheels are not configurable, their defaults are:
	Scroll mode:
		Wheels: Scrolling (clock-wise - scroll down)
		Wheel button: Switch between horizontal and vertical scrolling

	Zoom mode:
		Wheels: Zooming (clock-wise - zoom in)
		Wheel button: Not assigned

	Volume mode:
		Wheels: System volume control (clock-wise - increase volume)
		Wheel button: Toggle system sound on/off

Further, there's a program that appears in the Control Panel of Windows that is used to configure the stylus: 
	- pressure
	- double-click distance
	- both stylus buttons (defaults: bottom=right click; top=double left-click)
	- working space selection (monitors or user-defined screen size, mode: pen or mouse)
