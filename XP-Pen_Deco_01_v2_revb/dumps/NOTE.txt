Trying to get any diagnostics after the vid:pid change evoked through uc-logic probe with usbhid-dump for
this directory proved futile. I had to re-plug the tablet and get the old 28bd:0905 back instead of the 28bd:1227
so that I can leave any infos here.

On pen_pressure.txt
There seems to be a blinking LED for both of the buttons, however only the bottom one seems to evoke a variation in the long input stream, the top one only blinks the blue tablet LED. Could be there is something up where this
button refuses to work, though it is hard to tell and likely just speculation.
