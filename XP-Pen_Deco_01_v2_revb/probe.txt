Failed to get string descriptor 0xC8: Input/Output Error

Note that after this the vid:pid changed from 28bd:0905 to 28bd:1227 and the Device No. incremented by one
(eg.: Bus 001 Device 008 --> Bus 001 Device 009), I re-run the test and get this:

M 55 00 47 00 54 00 41 00 42 00 4C 00 45 00 54 00
P 54 00 41 00 42 00 4C 00 45 00 54 00

It remains constant after this, device No. doesn't change either.
